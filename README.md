I developed a Django website for gathering and processing data from various sources, 
storing it in a SQLite database, and displaying it on the interface and via a custom API. 
My solution was designed with scalability in mind, allowing the company to efficiently manage data 
for thousands of domains while ensuring data security. The user-friendly interface I created 
facilitated easy data interaction for team members.
Performance optimization measures were implemented to ensure rapid data retrieval and processing. 
Additionally, the project fostered collaboration between teams and departments, improving 
cross-functional communication and data sharing. I also provided ongoing maintenance and 
support to ensure the system's continued functionality and gathered user feedback for continuous improvements.
